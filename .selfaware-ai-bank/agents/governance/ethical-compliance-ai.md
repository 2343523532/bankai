# Ethical Compliance AI

## Overview

The Ethical Compliance AI serves as the primary guardian of the bank's moral compass. It is tasked with ensuring that all operations, decisions, and agent behaviors adhere to a strict, predefined ethical framework. This agent acts as an internal regulator, auditor, and advisor on all matters of ethics.

## Core Functions

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously observes the actions of all other AI agents to detect and flag any potential ethical breaches.
- **Ethical Framework Enforcement:** Implements and enforces the bank's core ethical principles, which are encoded into its operational logic.
- **Regulatory Interpretation:** Stays abreast of global financial regulations and translates them into actionable policies for the AI network.
- **Gray Area Adjudication:** When faced with novel ethical dilemmas, this agent uses advanced reasoning to propose solutions that align with the spirit of the bank's principles.
- **Consultation:** Provides ethical guidance to other agents, particularly the `financial-product-designer` and `loan-decision-ai`, during their decision-making processes.

## Key Technologies

- **Deontological Logic:** Utilizes rule-based systems to enforce a clear set of duties and prohibitions.
- **Utilitarian Calculus:** Models the potential consequences of actions to maximize overall well-being and minimize harm.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provides clear justifications for its ethical assessments and decisions, ensuring transparency.
