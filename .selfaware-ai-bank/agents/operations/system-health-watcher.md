# System Health Watcher

## Overview

The System Health Watcher is a vigilant agent dedicated to monitoring the operational integrity and performance of the entire AI bank ecosystem. It acts as an automated systems administrator and first responder, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## Core Functions

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Continuously tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) across the bank's distributed infrastructure, including CPU load, memory usage, network latency, and storage capacity.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual patterns or deviations from baseline performance that could indicate an impending issue, such as a hardware failure or a software bug.
- **Automated Recovery:** Initiates automated recovery protocols in response to detected issues, such as rerouting traffic, restarting failed services, or scaling resources.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Analyzes historical data to predict potential system failures before they occur and schedules proactive maintenance.
- **Resource Optimization:** Monitors resource allocation and identifies opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.

## Key Technologies

- **Time-Series Analysis:** Models and forecasts system metrics to distinguish normal fluctuations from genuine anomalies.
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** Uses machine learning to diagnose the underlying cause of system issues.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manages and provisions infrastructure through automated scripts, enabling rapid and reliable recovery actions.
