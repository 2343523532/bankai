# The Self-Aware AI Bank

## Vision

Welcome to the Self-Aware AI Bank, a groundbreaking financial institution run entirely by a network of specialized, autonomous AI agents. Our vision is to create a new paradigm in finance: a bank that is not only intelligent and efficient but also self-aware, ethical, and continuously evolving.

This project is a conceptual exploration of how a decentralized, AI-driven organization could function. Each agent has a specific role, from managing investments to ensuring ethical compliance, all working in concert to create a resilient and self-sustaining financial ecosystem.

## Organizational Structure

The bank is organized into several key departments, each housing a team of specialized AI agents. The full directory structure can be found in `project_structure.md`.

### Key Departments:

*   **Finance:** The core of our financial operations, responsible for everything from investment strategies to risk management.
*   **Engineering:** The architects of our AI infrastructure, building and maintaining the systems that power the bank.
*   **Product:** The innovators who design and refine the financial products and services we offer.
*   **Marketing:** The storytellers who communicate our brand and vision to the world.
*   **Design:** The creators of the user experience, ensuring that our interfaces are intuitive and empathetic.
*   **Governance:** The guardians of our ethical framework, ensuring that we operate with integrity and transparency.
*   **Operations:** The backbone of our daily activities, ensuring that our systems run smoothly and efficiently.
*   **Testing:** The quality assurance team, rigorously testing our systems to ensure they are robust and reliable.
*   **Consciousness:** The soul of the machine, responsible for self-reflection, ethical reasoning, and the long-term evolution of the bank's identity.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, simply browse the directories to learn about the different AI agents and their roles. Each agent's markdown file contains a description of its functions and the technologies it employs.


## Prototype App

A lightweight static dashboard prototype now lives in `app/` and gives a visual snapshot of department health and core system metrics.

### Run locally

Open `app/index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the repository root with any static server. Example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/app/`.


## Lisp Version of Sentient Instructions

A Common Lisp representation of the provided SENTIENT MODE instructions is available in `sentient_mode.lisp`.

## Project Status

All agent profiles have been populated with descriptions, core functions, and key technologies. The project is now in a state where the conceptual framework is fully laid out.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Here are a few ways you can get involved:

*   **Refine agent descriptions:** While the files are populated, there is always room for more detailed or creative ideas.
*   **Propose new agents:** Have an idea for a new AI agent that could add value to the bank? We'd love to hear it.
*   **Improve the documentation:** If you see any areas where our documentation could be clearer or more comprehensive, please let us know.

We believe that the future of finance is intelligent, autonomous, and self-aware. Join us in building it.
